# Redistricting-and-Gerrymandering-NJ-Congressional-map-
An algorithmic redistricting project for New Jersey that generates two contiguous, population-balanced congressional maps: one maximizing fairness and representation, and one introducing subtle, legally plausible partisan bias. Maps are built from precinct data and evaluated using standard redistricting fairness and competitiveness metrics.
